# fruit-search

This project was done as a part of Springboard's Software Engineering Career Track program. In this project, I built a small-scale autofill search bar that suggests various types of fruit from a list based on user input. If a user's typed input is contained anywhere in one of the fruits on the list, a scrollable drop down will appear containing all fruits that match. As a user continues to add letters to their input, the drop down suggestions narrow, and when a user clicks on one of these options, the search bar is populated with that suggestion.
