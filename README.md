# fruit-search

I completed this project as a part of Springboard's Software Engineering Career Track program. In this project, I built a small-scale autofill search bar that suggests various types of fruit from a list based on user input. If a user's typed input is contained anywhere in one of the fruits on the list, a scrollable dropdown will appear containing all fruits that match. The user's input is set apart in bold text. As a user continues to add letters to their input, the dropdown suggestions narrow. When a user clicks on one of these suggestions, the search bar is populated with the selected fruit.
